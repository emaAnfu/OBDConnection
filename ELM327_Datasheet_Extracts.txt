SAE J1979 standard defines ten possible diagnostic test modes:
01 - show current data
02 - show freeze frame data
03 - show diagnostic trouble codes
04 - clear trouble codes and stored values
05 - test results, oxygen sensors
...
09 - request vehicle information
0A - request permanent trouble codes

PID are the two following char that identify the parameter 
identification.
00 - shows which PIDs are supported by a certain mode

Each response from the ELM327 after a OBD command is composed by:
XX YY ZZZZ
where:	XX is the mode you sent + 40 
	YY is the PID you sent
	ZZZZ are the data requested

N.B. Pag. 31: you can add an hex digit at the end of you OBD command
to tell ELM327 how many lines it should wait for the response. This
can increase the response time. The default time for the AT ST timer
is 200 msec.
